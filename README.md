# Project Overview

In this project, we'll build a linear regression algorithm from scratch.  Linear regression is the most popular machine learning model.  Understanding how it works can help you apply it more effectively.

We'll create our algorithm using python and pandas.  We'll then compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn.
